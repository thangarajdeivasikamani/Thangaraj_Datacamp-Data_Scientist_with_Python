## Subsetting rows

A large part of data science is about finding which bits of your dataset are interesting. One of the simplest techniques for this is to find a subset of rows that match some criteria. This is sometimes known as *filtering rows* or *selecting rows*.

There are many ways to subset a DataFrame, perhaps the most common is to use relational operators to return `True` or `False` for each row, then pass that inside square **brackets**.

```
dogs[dogs["height_cm"] > 60]
dogs[dogs["color"] == "tan"]
```

You can filter for multiple conditions at once by using the "logical and" operator, `&`.

```
dogs[(dogs["height_cm"] > 60) & (dogs["col_b"] == "tan")]
```

`homelessness` is available and `pandas` is loaded as `pd`.

<hr>

**Instructions 1/3**

Filter `homelessness` for cases where the number of individuals is greater than ten thousand, assigning to `ind_gt_10k`. *View the printed result*.

**Instructions 2/3**

Filter `homelessness` for cases where the USA Census region is `"Mountain"`, assigning to `mountain_reg`. *View the printed result*.

**Instructions 3/3**

Filter `homelessness` for cases where the number of family members is less than one thousand and the region is `"Pacific"`, assigning to `fam_lt_1k_pac`. *View the printed result*.

## Script
```
# Filter for rows where individuals is greater than 10000
ind_gt_10k = homelessness[(homelessness["individuals"]) > 10000]
# See the result
print(ind_gt_10k)
```
```
# Filter for rows where region is Mountain
mountain_reg = homelessness[(homelessness["region"] == "Mountain")]
# See the result
print(mountain_reg)
```
```
# Filter for rows where family_members is less than 1000
# and region is Pacific
fam_lt_1k_pac = homelessness[(homelessness["family_members"] < 1000) &(homelessness["region"] == "Pacific")]
# See the result
print(fam_lt_1k_pac)
```
