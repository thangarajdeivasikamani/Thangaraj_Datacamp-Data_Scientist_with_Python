## Sorting rows

Finding interested bits of data in a DataFrame is often easier if you change the order of the rows. You can sort the rows by passing a column name to .sort_values().

In cases where rows have the same value (this is common if you sort on a categorical variable), you may wish to break the ties by sorting on another column. You can sort on multiple columns in this way by passing a list of column names.

| Sort on ...      | Syntax                                   |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| One column       | `df.sort_values("breed")`                |
| Multiple columns | `df.sort_values(["breed", "weight_kg"])` |

By combining `.sort_values()` with `.head()`, you can answer questions in the form, "What are the top cases where...?".

`homelessness` is available and `pandas` is loaded as `pd`.

**Instructions (1/3)**

* Sort `homelessness` by the number of homeless individuals, from smallest to largest, and save this as `homelessness_ind`.
* Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.

**Instructions (2/3)**

* Sort `homelessness` by the number of homeless family members in descending order, and save this as `homelessness_fam`.
* Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.

**Instructions (3/3)**

* Sort `homelessness` first by region (ascending), and then by number of family members (descending). Save this as `homelessness_reg_fam`.
* Print the head of the sorted DataFrame.

## Script
```
# Sort homelessness by individual
homelessness_ind = homelessness.sort_values("individuals")

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_ind.head())
```
```
# Sort homelessness by descending family members
homelessness_fam = homelessness.sort_values("family_members", ascending=False)

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_fam.head())
```
```
# Sort homelessness by region, then descending family members
homelessness_reg_fam = homelessness.sort_values(["region", "family_members"], ascending=[True, False])

# Print the top few rows
print(homelessness_reg_fam.head())
```
