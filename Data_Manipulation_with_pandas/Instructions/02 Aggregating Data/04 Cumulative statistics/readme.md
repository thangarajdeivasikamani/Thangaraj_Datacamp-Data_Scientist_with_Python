## Cumulative statistics

Cumulative statistics can also be helpful in tracking summary statistics over time. In this exercise, you'll calculate the cumulative sum and cumulative max of a department's weekly sales, which will allow you to identify what the total sales were so far as well as what the highest weekly sales were so far.

A DataFrame called `sales_1_1` has been created for you, which contains the sales data for department 1 of store 1. `pandas` is loaded as `pd`.

<hr>

**Instructions**

* Sort the rows of `sales_1_1` by the `date` column in ascending order.
* Get the cumulative sum of `weekly_sales` and add it as a new column of `sales_1_1` called `cum_weekly_sales`.
* Get the cumulative maximum of `weekly_sales`, and add it as a column called `cum_max_sales`.
* Print the `date`, `weekly_sales`, `cum_weekly_sales`, and `cum_max_sales` columns.

## Script
```
# Sort sales_1_1 by date
sales_1_1 = sales_1_1.sort_values("date")

# Get the cumulative sum of weekly_sales, add as cum_weekly_sales col
sales_1_1["cum_weekly_sales"] = sales_1_1["weekly_sales"].cumsum()

# Get the cumulative max of weekly_sales, add as cum_max_sales col
sales_1_1["cum_max_sales"] = sales_1_1["weekly_sales"].cummax()

# See the columns you calculated
print(sales_1_1[["date", "weekly_sales", "cum_weekly_sales", "cum_max_sales"]])
```

## Output
