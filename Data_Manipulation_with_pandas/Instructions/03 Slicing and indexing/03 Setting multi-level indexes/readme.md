## Setting multi-level indexes

Indexes can also be made out of multiple columns, forming a *multi-level index* (sometimes called a *hierarchical index*). There is a trade-off to using these.

The benefit is that multi-level indexes make it more natural to reason about nested categorical variables. For example, in a clinical trial you might have control and treatment groups. Then each test subject belongs to one or other group, and we can say that test subject is nested inside treatment group. Similarly, in the temperature dataset, the city is located in the country, so we can say city is nested inside country.

The main downside is that the code for manipulating indexes is different to the code for the manipulating columns, so you have to learn two syntaxes, and keep track of how your data is represented.

`pandas` is loaded as `pd`. `temperatures` is available.

**Instructions**

* Set the index of `temperatures` to the `"country"` and `"city"` columns, assigning to `temperatures_ind`.
* Specify two country/city pairs to keep: `"Brazil"`/`"Rio De Janeiro"` and `"Pakistan"`/`"Lahore"`, assigning to `rows_to_keep`.
* Subset for `rows_to_keep` using `.loc[]`.

## Script
```
# Index temperatures by country & city
temperatures_ind = temperatures.set_index(["country", "city"])

# List of tuples: Brazil, Rio De Janeiro & Pakistan, Lahore
rows_to_keep = [("Brazil", "Rio De Janeiro"), ("Pakistan", "Lahore")]

# Subset for rows to keep
print(temperatures_ind.loc[rows_to_keep])
```

## Output
